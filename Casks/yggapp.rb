  caveats <<~EOS
    YggApp runs in the menu bar. On first launch macOS asks you to allow its
    network extension in System Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions,
    and the first connection asks to add a VPN configuration.

    The tunnel is a system extension, so YggApp must stay in /Applications.
    To remove the extension and the VPN profile completely, quit YggApp and
    move it to the Trash from Finder (which unloads the extension) before or
    instead of `brew uninstall`, then delete "YggApp" in System Settings > VPN.
